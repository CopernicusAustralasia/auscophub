A standard Python setup.py script is provided. 

Use the command 
    python setup.py install
to install in standard locations (/usr/local/bin). To nominate non-standard locations,
use the --prefix option, e.g.
    python setup.py install --prefix=~/auscophub

If using a non-standard prefix directory, it needs to be in your $PYTHONPATH, and the
bin/ subdirectory needs to be in your $PATH.
