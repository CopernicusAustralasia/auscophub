A standard Python setup.py script is provided.

In this allegedly modern world, the best way to execute the setup.py
script is via pip, so you will need available.

Download the tar.gz and untar it (or zip, if preferred).

  cd auscophub-1.2.3
  pip install .

If you wish to install in a non-standard location, the pip command
has a --prefix option for this. You will then need to manage
the PATH and PYTHONPATH accordingly, for the directories
    <prefix>/bin/
    <prefix>/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/
respectively.
