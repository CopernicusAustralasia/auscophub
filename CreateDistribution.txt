How to create a distribution of AusCopHub. 

1. Ensure that you have fetched and committed everything which needs to go in.
2. Change the version number in the auscophub/__init__.py. Version number
   is of the form a.b.c, as discussed below. 
   DON'T FORGET TO COMMIT THIS, BEFORE THE NEXT STEP!!!!
3. Update the release notes page doc/source/releasenotes.rst, by going 
   through the change logs since the last release, and noting what 
   has been done. 
4. Use "hg tag" to add a version number tag, e.g.
    hg tag 1.1.0
5. Create the distribution tarball, using
    python setup.py sdist
   This creates a tar.gz under a subdirectory called dist
6. Upload this to bitbucket, under the downloads tab. 


Version Numbers.
The AusCopHub version number is structured as A.B.C. 
- The A number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The B number should change for introduction of significant new features
- The C number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes.
