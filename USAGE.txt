Current the only main program is auscophub_storeSen2zipfile.py. It is used to move
one or more SAFE-format zipfiles into their final home, and create associated
XML and PNG files. 

It takes a --help option, to give full commandline help. 

For moving one file, normal usage would be something like
    auscophub_storeSen2zipfile.py --storagetopdir /some/directory S2A_OPER_PRD_MSIL1C_PDMC_20160407T190635_R116_V20160406T001844_20160406T002213.zip
This would move the given zipfile into a directory structure under /some/directory, with
directory levels for year/year-month/gridCellName/
where the grid cell name is a readable label for a 5 degree lat/long grid cell. In this particular 
case, it would be
    /some/directory/2016/2016-04/20S145E-25S150E/

The input zipfile name can include its full path. 

It can also be used to move a large list of zipfile. These are placed in a text file, one 
zipfile per line, and this text file name is given to the --zipfilelist option, e.g.
    auscophub_storeSen2zipfile.py --storagetopdir /some/directory --zipfilelist ziplist.txt

Note the options for testing:
    --dummy         Do nothing, just report
    --verbose       Report what is happening, as it happens
    --copy          Instead of moving the zipfile, copy it to its final location, 
                    leaving the original untouched
